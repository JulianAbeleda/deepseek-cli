# Changelog

This changelog tracks public release notes. Older `Phase` entries are internal
development milestones and may not represent every implementation phase.

## v1.5.0 - File Creation and Fuzzy Workspace Routing

Summary:

- Added approval-gated `create_file` support so agents can request new files
  directly instead of falling back to shell heredocs or saying file creation is
  unavailable.
- Kept file creation under the same user-in-the-loop approval model as shell
  commands and patch edits, including denial handling and root-scoped approval
  behavior.
- Added follow-up style reminders after tool rounds and retry paths so final
  agent answers keep the expected concise Markdown shape across longer turns.
- Added fuzzy workspace routing for arrow-chain prompts such as
  `go to my env -> pkosv2 -> structure. find your purpose`, while exact matches
  still win first.
- Added fuzzy handling for dotted trailing-task syntax such as
  `go to my env -> pkosv2. find your purpose`.
- Made ambiguous fuzzy route matches fail closed with a root error instead of
  silently choosing a directory or falling back to a parent root.
- Expanded dock approval and routing smoke coverage for create-file approvals,
  fuzzy route disclosure, and ambiguous dotted-route failures.

## v1.4.0 - Native Tool Calls and Composer Paste Context

Summary:

- Added native OpenAI-compatible tool calling for the DeepSeek agent path,
  including assistant `tool_calls`, tool-result messages, multi-tool batches,
  and legacy JSON decision fallback.
- Preserved `reasoning_content` and nullable assistant tool-call content in
  provider message handling.
- Kept shell and write tools behind the existing approval gate while allowing
  read-only native tool calls to flow through the agent loop.
- Added compact paste handling in the docked composer: multiline or large
  pasted content displays as `[pasted context - N chars]` while the full pasted
  text is submitted to the model.
- Preserved compact pasted context through history recall so resubmitted
  history entries send the original pasted text, not the display marker.
- Added arrow-chain workspace navigation for prompts that combine path movement
  with a trailing task.

```

## v1.3.0 - Dock Stability and Direct Agent Routing

Summary:

- Removed the legacy `route: agent task` confirmation popup. Declarative
  workspace tasks now route directly into agent execution after root and path
  checks.
- Kept shell and write actions behind the dock approval gate, making tool
  approval the source of permissions.
- Stabilized progress dock rendering by buffering dock updates and redrawing
  only when progress text changes.
- Hardened agent transcript storage with collision-resistant filenames and
  numeric latest-transcript sorting.
- Made streaming provider calls cancellation-aware.
- Tightened agent JSON extraction so trailing prose no longer breaks otherwise
  valid decisions.
- Released package and Homebrew tap as `v1.3.0`.

## Phase 17 - Internet Tools

Addendum:

- `/features` now shows which API-backed capabilities are enabled by the
  current shell environment without printing secret values.

Summary:

- Normal chat now prefetches web context for URL and current-info prompts,
  continuing with a warning if web context is unavailable.
- Explicit agent mode can call `web_search` and `fetch_url` as read-only tools.
- Search defaults to Brave via `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` or `BRAVE_API_KEY`.
- `DEEPSEEK_SEARCH_PROVIDER=tavily` switches search to Tavily via `TAVILY_API_KEY`.
- `fetch_url` is limited to HTTP(S), validates DNS/IP and redirect targets, rejects
  restricted addresses, and caps response size, redirects, and timeout.

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --offline
cargo clippy --offline
```

## Phase 12 - Dock-Native Approval First Slice

Reliability addendum:

- OpenAI-style agent decisions now preserve multiple tool calls and execute them
  in order within one provider step.
- Placeholder final content such as `answer with concrete findings` no longer
  masks real `blocked` or `final_answer` fields.
- Patch failure-mode coverage now tracks ambiguous replacements and changed-file
  races across the provider CLIs.

Summary:

- Docked model-decided routing can now request approval for `run_shell` and
  `propose_patch` through the bottom composer.
- Approval requests render above the dock.
- `n` denies the pending tool request.
- Exact approval phrases approve one tool request:
  - `yes run` for `run_shell`
  - `yes apply` for `propose_patch`
- Explicit agent mode still keeps its existing terminal approval prompts.

Validation:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --offline

```

## Phase 11 - Live Validated Docked Routing

Tags:

- `phase11-parity-complete`
- `phase11-live-validated`

Summary:

- Default docked chat now uses the model-decided agent runtime path.
- Tool progress renders above the dock as `agent step N: tool_name`.
- Final answers render above the dock without an `agent task:` stdout handoff.
- `/runtime legacy-routing on|off` toggles the deterministic Phase 10 fallback.
- Docked chat can use read-only workspace tools.
- Shell commands and edits are denied in docked routing until a dock-native
  approval UI is scoped.
- Explicit agent mode still owns the rough `yes run` and `yes apply` approval
  prompts.

Validation:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --offline
cargo build --release --offline
python3 scripts/phase11-docked-routing-smoke.py --binary target/release/deepseek
python3 scripts/docked-smoke.py --binary target/release/deepseek --entrypoint default
python3 scripts/docked-smoke.py --binary target/release/deepseek --entrypoint chat
```

Live validation requires `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and network access:

```bash
python3 scripts/live-docked-routing-smoke.py --binary target/release/deepseek
```
